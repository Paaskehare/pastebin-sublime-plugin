This is a simple plugin for Sublime Text 2 to allow for easily pasting code to a pastebin

It takes the current selection in a file, uploads it to metabox, and returns the URL to the clipboard.

Installation:
  Linux: move "metabox.py" to ~/.config/sublime-text-2/Packages/User/
  
  Bind a key to upload, like:
    { "keys": ["super+m"], "command": "metabox" }

Select some text, and press Super + m, and you're good to go!

Good luck!

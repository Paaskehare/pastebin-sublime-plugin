Sublime Pastebin Plugin
======================

This is a simple plugin for [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com) to allow for easily pasting code to a pastebin

It takes the current selection in a file, uploads it to (by default) [i.ole.im](http://i.ole.im), and returns the URL to the clipboard.

Support
-------
Sublime Pastebin Plugin supports both [Sublime Text 2](http://www.sublimetext.com/2) and [Sublime Text 3](http://www.sublimetext.com/3)

Installation
------------

Clone this repo into your Sublime Text Packages directory
(replace 2 with 3 if you use sublime text 3)
###Linux
    cd ~/.config/sublime-text-2/Packages/
    git clone git://github.com/Paaskehare/pastebin-sublime-plugin.git

###Mac
    cd ~/"Library/Application Support/Sublime Text 2/Packages/"
    git clone git://github.com/Paaskehare/pastebin-sublime-plugin.git

Usage
-----

Select some text (or don't) and hit `ctrl + alt + c` and afterwards `ctrl + v` - and you're good to go!

*Good luck!*

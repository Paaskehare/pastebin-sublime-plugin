Metabox Sublime Plugin
======================

This is a simple plugin for [Sublime Text 2](http://www.sublimetext.com/2) to allow for easily pasting code to a pastebin

It takes the current selection in a file, uploads it to [Metabox](http://dl.gs), and returns the URL to the clipboard.


Installation
------------

Clone this repo into your Sublime Text 2 Packages directory
###Linux
    cd ~/.config/sublime-text-2/Packages/User/
    git clone https://github.com/Paaskehare/metabox-sublime-plugin.git

###Mac
    cd ~/"Library/Application Support/Sublime Text 2/Packages/"
    git clone https://github.com/Paaskehare/metabox-sublime-plugin.git

Usage
-----

Select some text (or dont) and hit `Super + m` and afterwards `ctrl + v` - and you're good to go!

*Good luck!*
